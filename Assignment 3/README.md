9. Gen AI and Prompt Engineering:
**A. Scenario:** 
Create a VBA macro (sub), call it Intelligent_Data_Analyzer, that analyzes a dynamically selected range of Excel cells and performs contextual operations based on the cell content. The challenge is to design a system where the macro can infer the type of data and apply appropriate transformations or generate intelligent outputs.

**B. Requirements:**
- Dynamic Range Selection:
o Allow the user to select a range of cells to analyze.
- Contextual Analysis:
o The macro should infer the data type and apply transformations based on the following rules:
- Numeric Data:
▪ Identify if the number is an integer, decimal, or percentage.

▪ Output whether the number is small, medium, or large based on thresholds.

▪ Calculate its square or square root.
- Text Data:
▪ Reverse the text if it's a single word.

▪ Count words if it’s a sentence.

▪ Convert the case (e.g., lowercase to uppercase).
- Dates:
▪ Identify the day of the week.

▪ Calculate how many days have passed since the date.
- Empty Cells:
▪ Flag them with a message: "Empty Cell – Please Add Data."

**C. Output Results:**
• Place the processed results in the adjacent column to the right of each
analyzed cell.

**D. Error Handling:**
• Gracefully handle unexpected data types or issues (e.g., invalid dates).

**E. Constraints:**
• The macro must dynamically handle any size range, even if the user
selects non-contiguous cells.
• Modular and reusable VBA code for scalability.
