1. Using AutoProduction sheet
- Graph the time series of auto production
- Find the equation of the linear regression of the time series
- Find the correlation coefficient, R2. What does it mean and what does it say?
- Using the graph, forecast the auto sales for the next 6 month
- Repeat D, but for the next 24 month
- Do you trust the forecast results in E. Why or why not?
  
2. Using AutoProduction sheet
- Calculate the 6 month MA
- Calculate the 12 month MA
- Which MA provide a better trend? Why

3. Using the YankeeRuns
- Calculate the average runs for all the years. then copy it in column C
- Graph the time series of the yearly runs and the average to visualize it
- What do you see?
  
4. Using AmazonRevenues sheet
- Graph the quarterly revenues
- Identify the seasonality in the time series
- Explain why this seasonality occurs
- Create the quarterly MA
- What does this MA do?

5. Using Three sheet
- Graph the three time series given
- Insert a trendline for each
- Which time series have more noise than the other and why?

6. Using ThreeF sheet
- Calculate the error columns shown
- Which forecast is better than the other? Why?

7. Using E1 sheet
- Calculate MAD
- Is this forecasting model good or bad? Explain you answer

8. Using E2 sheet
- Calculate MAD
- Calculate MAPE
- What is your conclusion?

9. Using E3 sheet, calculate SSE

10. Using E4 sheet
- Calculate the bias
- What is you conclusion
  
11. Using E5, determine if the Forecast 1 bias is significant and if Forecast 2 bias is
significant

12. Gen AI Prompt Engineering: use your favorite AI Chat Bot to solve the following
problem:
- Use the excel file with the name Temperature_Forecasting.xlsx. it has 15 days of
previous temps.
- Feed the data to Gen AI bot and ask it to use it to create a linear regression model
- Redo Steps B and C above in excel
- Compare excel model with Gen AI model: compare the coefficients of the two
regression models, i.e. compare the Y-intercept and the slope, say β0 and β1 in
the equation: Y = β0 + β1X + ε. Are they equal? They should be. If not try other
bots.
- Ask Gen AI to predict the temperature for days 16-21
- To measure the accuracy of the model, ask Gen AI bot to calculate the
temperatures for days 5 – 15. The bot should be able to use the independent
variable x (day # in this problem) and calculate the dependent variable Y
(temperature in this problem)
- Ask Gen AI to create a table with actual values, predicted values, and the error
(difference) for days 5 – 15
- Ask Gen AI to calculate the model accuracy: ask it which error formula it used
- Ask Gen AI to create a line chart showing the actual and predicted temperatures
for days 5 - 15
